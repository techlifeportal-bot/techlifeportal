        <h2>About TechLifePortal</h2>
        <p>
          TechLifePortal is a Bangalore-focused platform built
          exclusively for IT professionals. The goal is simple —
          to make everyday IT life easier by bringing trusted,
          relevant information into one place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of generic listings, TechLifePortal focuses on
          real needs around IT hubs — where to stay, where to go
          on weekends, and how to balance work with life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This platform is currently in beta and will grow
          gradually based on feedback from the IT community.
